# 📊 Excel Dashboard Project: Dynamic Business Insights

Welcome to my Excel Dashboard project — a fully interactive, filter-driven analytics tool built to transform raw business data into clear, actionable insights. This project demonstrates my ability to automate reporting, apply formulas, and design clean, user-friendly dashboards using Excel.
